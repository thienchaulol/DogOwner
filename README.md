# Puppy-Party

Puppy Party is an incremental mobile app. THe user taps for in-game currency and can purchase upgrades for their character.
I developed Puppy Party using Unity and used C# for scripting. I have implemented a working GUI, score display, purchases,
upgrades, and animations by manipulating sprites and utilizing object pooling.
